    <h1>Best Activities to do in Madison, Wisconsin</h1>
    
    <h1>1. Henry Vilas Zoo</h1>
    <p>The zoo is a perfect place to go with your family and friends.  It is a great place for people of all ages.  There are so many different types of animals, reptiles, wild life, and aquatic creatures that you can find here! I even went here for my past birthday with my friends!</p>

    <h2>2. Statue of Liberty on Lake Mendota</h2>
    
    <p>Once the Cold Wisconsin weather finally begins to start and Lake Mendota freezes, once a year the New York Statue of Liberty is found on the lake.  It is so fun to look at and take pictures of with your friends!</p>
